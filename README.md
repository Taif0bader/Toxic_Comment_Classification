# Toxic_Comment_Classification

 Due to their fear of being harassed and attacked online, many people stop speaking up and give up looking for alternative opinions. due to platforms' poor ability to foster dialogues, several communities have begun to restrict or remove user comments that encourage people to quit a topic.

 Our aim is to develop a model for our project that can identify various types of toxicity. We believe that by making these changes online discourse will improve in terms of both its content and its interactivity.
